## 🎯 Quick Start for Monday

### 1. Setup (One-time, 20 minutes)
```bash
# Clone repository
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/trentleslie/equine-microbiome-reporter.git
cd equine-microbiome-reporter

# Setup environment
conda create -n equine-microbiome python=3.9 -y
conda activate equine-microbiome

# Install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy jinja2 pyyaml flask werkzeug biopython openpyxl python-dotenv jupyter notebook ipykernel tqdm psutil -y
pip install reportlab weasyprint

# Configure (IMPORTANT: Update paths in .env to match your system!)
cp .env.hippovet .env  
# Edit .env file to update these paths:
#   - KRAKEN2_DB_PATH: Your Epi2Me PlusPFP-16 database location
#   - OUTPUT_BASE_PATH: Where you want results saved
#   - Other database paths as needed
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# Test
python scripts/test_installation.py
```

### 2. Process Your First Sample
```bash
# With your Kraken2 report
python scripts/continue_pipeline.py \
    --kreport-dir /path/to/your/kreports \
    --output-dir results

# Or with FASTQ files
python scripts/full_pipeline.py \
    --input-dir /path/to/fastq \
    --output-dir results
```

### 3. Review Results
Check the `results/` directory for:
- 📊 **excel_review/** - Clinical filtering results for review
- 📄 **pdf_reports/** - Final PDF reports
- 📈 **csv_files/** - Processed data files
