# Email Response to Lab Manager

Hi!

I've fixed all the issues you reported and pushed the updates to GitHub. Please pull the latest changes:

```bash
cd ~/equine-microbiome-reporter
git pull origin main
```

## Fixes Applied:

1. **--barcodes argument now works**: You can specify specific barcodes to process:
   ```bash
   python scripts/full_pipeline.py --input-dir /mnt/c/data/... --output-dir /mnt/c/Users/... --barcodes barcode04,barcode05,barcode06
   ```

2. **Kraken2 database path from .env**: The script now reads `KRAKEN2_DB_PATH` from your .env file. I've created a template for you:
   ```bash
   cp .env.hippovet .env
   ```
   This template already has the correct database path: `/mnt/c/Users/hippovet/epi2melabs/data/PlusPFP-8/k2_pluspfp_08gb_20240605_db`

3. **Both issues resolved**: After pulling and setting up the .env file, your commands should work correctly.

Quick setup:
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Copy the HippoVet+ template to .env
cp .env.hippovet .env

# Test with specific barcodes
python scripts/full_pipeline.py \
  --input-dir /mnt/c/data/DIAG_03_09_2025/no_sample_id/20250903_1818_MN33193_FBD78983_0b901b20/fastq_pass/ \
  --output-dir /mnt/c/Users/hippovet/Desktop/EM_Reporter/output/results \
  --barcodes barcode06
```

Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

## What This Pipeline Does:
The `full_pipeline.py` script performs the complete workflow:
1. **Combines** multiple FASTQ files from each barcode directory
2. **Runs Kraken2** to classify bacterial species from the sequencing data
3. **Filters** results to focus on clinically relevant bacteria
4. **Generates PDF reports** with dysbiosis analysis and clinical interpretations

## Next Steps (Once Pipeline Runs):
After confirming the pipeline runs without errors, we should:

1. **Review the generated PDF reports** in `/mnt/c/Users/hippovet/Desktop/EM_Reporter/output/results/pdf_reports/`
   - Check if the report format meets your clinical needs
   - Verify the dysbiosis index calculations are meaningful
   - Review the species identification and percentages

2. **Test with real patient data**:
   - Process a known sample where you have expected results
   - Compare the PDF output with your current reporting methods
   - Identify any missing information or formatting improvements needed

3. **Focus areas for refinement**:
   - Polish translation (if Polish reports are needed)
   - Customize clinical interpretations and recommendations
   - Adjust dysbiosis thresholds based on your clinical experience
   - Add your clinic's branding/logo to the PDF reports

Please run a test with one or two barcodes first, then send me:
- Any error messages
- A sample PDF report (if successfully generated)
- Your feedback on what needs adjustment in the reports

Best,
[Your name]
