Hi Gosia,

Great news on WSL2! I've been testing in WSL2 and got it working perfectly in a virtual machine setup, so your environment is ideal for what we've built.

**Ready for Monday**

Everything's tested and ready for deployment. The system now:
- Processes your weekly 15-sample batches in under 2.5 hours total
- Reduces manual curation from 30-40 minutes to 5-10 minutes per sample (75% reduction)
- Generates both Excel review files and PDF reports
- Works directly with your existing Epi2Me/Nextflow pipeline

Note: The PDF layout still needs some refinement which I'll complete tomorrow night, but the core pipeline and Excel review generation are fully functional for testing. Once I update the PDF layout, you'll just need to run `git pull` to get the updates.

**Customization Features You Requested**

The clinical relevance lists are fully editable - you can add/remove species in the Excel files or directly in the configuration. Thresholds are adjustable in the `.env` configuration file (MIN_ABUNDANCE_THRESHOLD, CLINICAL_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD, etc.). The system learns from your edits and we can incorporate your feedback to continuously improve the filtering.

**Quick Start for Monday**

Everything's ready in the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/trentleslie/equine-microbiome-reporter

Start here: [READY_FOR_MONDAY.md](https://github.com/trentleslie/equine-microbiome-reporter/blob/main/READY_FOR_MONDAY.md)

For detailed setup: [DEPLOYMENT_WSL2_COMPLETE.md](https://github.com/trentleslie/equine-microbiome-reporter/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT_WSL2_COMPLETE.md)

The main thing you'll need to do is update the paths in the `.env.hippovet` configuration file to match your Epi2Me installation location.

**Next Steps**

1. Clone the repository and run the test script
2. Process a few samples to verify the time savings
3. Let me know what species you want to add/remove from the clinical lists
4. We'll refine based on your real-world testing feedback

Looking forward to hearing how Monday's testing goes!

Best,
Trent

P.S. The system handles all three of your databases (PlusPFP-16, EuPathDB, Viral) with appropriate filtering for each. The Excel review sheets show exactly what was filtered and why, giving you complete control over the process.
