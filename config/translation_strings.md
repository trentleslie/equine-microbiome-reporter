## Clinical Assessment Text

| Key | English | Polish | German |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| `healthy_balanced` | healthy and balanced |  |  |
| `assessment_normal` | The microbiome analysis reveals a healthy and balanced gut microbial community. The dysbiosis index of {di} falls within the normal range (0-20), indicating optimal microbial diversity and composition. The major bacterial phyla are present in appropriate proportions, supporting proper digestive function and immune homeostasis. |  |  |
| `assessment_mild` | The microbiome analysis indicates mild dysbiosis with an index of {di}. This suggests a moderate imbalance in the gut microbial community that may benefit from targeted intervention. While not immediately concerning, this imbalance could impact digestive efficiency and immune function if left unaddressed. |  |  |
| `assessment_severe` | The microbiome analysis reveals severe dysbiosis with an index of {di}. This indicates a significant imbalance in the gut microbial community requiring immediate attention. The disrupted microbial ecology may compromise digestive function, nutrient absorption, and immune responses. |  |  |
