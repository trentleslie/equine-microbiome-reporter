# NCBI Sample Configuration
# Configuration for downloading and processing equine microbiome FASTQ files from NCBI SRA
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/ncbi_batch_pipeline.py --config config/ncbi_samples.yaml

# List of samples to download and process
# These are real equine gut microbiome samples from NCBI BioProject PRJNA871798

# Pipeline configuration
pipeline:
  output_dir: "ncbi_output"
  skip_kraken: false  # Set to true to skip Kraken2 classification

# Kraken2 database configuration (optional, will use environment variable if not specified)
# kraken2_db: "/path/to/kraken2/database"

# Instructions:
# 1. Replace the placeholder SRA accessions with actual equine microbiome accession numbers
# 2. Update patient/sample information as needed
# 3. Run: python scripts/ncbi_batch_pipeline.py --config config/ncbi_samples.yaml
#
# Finding equine microbiome datasets on NCBI:
# - Search NCBI SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra
# - Search terms: "equine microbiome", "horse gut microbiome", "equine fecal 16S"
# - Filter by: Amplicon sequencing, 16S rRNA
# - Look for BioProjects with multiple samples
#
# Example equine microbiome studies:
# - PRJNA516732: Equine Gut Microbiome Study
# - PRJNA685642: Horse Fecal Microbiome Analysis
# - PRJNA397906: Equine Hindgut Microbial Community
