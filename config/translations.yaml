  bacillota_description: Associated with reduced fiber fermentation and butyrate production.
  bacteroidota_description: May indicate compromised carbohydrate metabolism.
  pseudomonadota_description: May indicate inflammation or pathogenic overgrowth.
  balanced_description: All major phyla within reference ranges. Optimal conditions
    for digestive health.
  healthy_balanced: healthy and balanced
  assessment_normal: The microbiome analysis reveals a healthy and balanced gut microbial
    community. The dysbiosis index of {di} falls within the normal range (0-20), indicating
    optimal microbial diversity and composition. The major bacterial phyla are present
    in appropriate proportions, supporting proper digestive function and immune homeostasis.
  assessment_mild: The microbiome analysis indicates mild dysbiosis with an index
    of {di}. This suggests a moderate imbalance in the gut microbial community that
    may benefit from targeted intervention. While not immediately concerning, this
    imbalance could impact digestive efficiency and immune function if left unaddressed.
  assessment_severe: The microbiome analysis reveals severe dysbiosis with an index
    of {di}. This indicates a significant imbalance in the gut microbial community
    requiring immediate attention. The disrupted microbial ecology may compromise
    digestive function, nutrient absorption, and immune responses.

    daily minimum'
  rec_severe_2: Implement therapeutic probiotic protocol with veterinary guidance
  rec_severe_3: Eliminate or significantly reduce concentrate feeds temporarily

  rec_severe_6: Screen for underlying gastrointestinal pathology if dysbiosis persists
  guide_normal_1: Consistent feeding schedule (2-3 times daily)
  guide_normal_2: Continuous access to forage (pasture or hay)
  guide_normal_3: Gradual feed changes over 10-14 days
  guide_normal_4: Regular dental care and parasite control

  guide_mild_1: Increase forage intake to at least 1.5-2% body weight
  guide_mild_2: Reduce grain meals to <0.5% body weight per feeding
  guide_mild_3: Add probiotic supplement (10^9 CFU daily)
  guide_mild_4: Consider prebiotic fiber sources (beet pulp, psyllium)
  guide_mild_5: Ensure adequate water intake (30-50L daily)
  guide_severe_1: Immediate dietary restructuring under veterinary guidance
  guide_severe_2: Maximize forage, minimize concentrates
  guide_severe_3: Therapeutic probiotic protocol (10^10 CFU daily)
