## Page 3: Clinical Analysis

### Dysbiosis Index (DI): 4.0 - Normal microbiota (healthy).
Lack of dysbiosis signs; gut microflora is balanced with minor deviations.

### UNICELLULAR PARASITE PROFILE
No unicellular parasite genome identified in the sample

### VIRAL PROFILE
No viral genome identified in the sample

### DESCRIPTION:
Molecular examination revealed gut microflora properly balanced with minor deviations. 
High percentage of Bacillota sp. (26.32%) and Lysinibacillus sp. (11.37%) may indicate 
adaptations of microflora to environmental changes or to animal's current diet. Additionally 
detected are dominant fermentation bacteria such as Roseburia spp., Lachnospira eligens, 
Fibrobacter succinogenes, and Anaerobacterium hallii, which may contribute to efficient 
digestion of complex carbohydrates. These are not pathogenic bacteria that would disrupt 
proper gut microflora functioning. No genetic material from unicellular parasites or viruses 
was identified.

### IMPORTANT:
According to applied methodology, it is possible that negative results were obtained despite 
presence of some genomes. Part of genomes identified may come from environmental contamination. 
In connection with this recommendation, when interpreting test results pharmacotherapy should 
be preceded by additional diagnostic tests.

### MICROSCOPIC-BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS
**Deviation from normal**

#### Appearance
- **Color:** Brown
- **Consistency:** Normal
- **Odor:** Neutral
- **Mucus:** Within normal limits
- **Water content:** Normal
- **Parasites:** Not observed
- **Sand presence:** Present ↑

### DESCRIPTION:
In the macroscopic examination, dark brown color, normal consistency, and neutral odor of fecal 
material were observed. These are typical parameters of equine feces. Water content in feces was 
normal, suggesting proper hydration. Feces observed had minimal mucus content in upper layers. 
Sand presence may cause gastrointestinal irritation and in severe cases lead to sand colic.

### PARASITE SCREENING
**Deviation from normal**

- **Anoplocephala perfoliata:** Not observed
- **Oxyuris equi:** Not observed  
- **Parascaris equorum:** Not observed
- **Strongylidae:** Present, few eggs ↑

### DESCRIPTION:
In the microscopic examination of fecal material, few Strongylidae eggs were observed, but no larvae 
of this parasite. Presence of eggs without larvae indicates a breeding phase or recent infection. 
We recommend monitoring the animal's health and scheduling follow-up examination after the treatment 
cycle, which should eliminate the parasite.

### MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION
**Deviation from normal**

- **Leukocytes:** Not observed
- **Erythrocytes:** Not observed
- **Yeast cells:** Present, few ↑
- **Rhabditiform nematodes:** Not observed
- **Plant fibers:** Present
- **Cereal grains:** Not observed

### DESCRIPTION:
In the microscopic examination of fecal material, few yeast cells were observed, which may indicate 
intestinal dysbiosis. This is related to diet high in easily fermentable carbohydrates. There were 
no inflammatory markers present such as leukocytes and erythrocytes. Protozoan parameters were 
normal - excluding pathology of these microorganisms. Macroscopically examined feces contained plant 
fibers typical for herbivore diet. In feces, presence of protein fragments was detected, which in 
high quantity may indicate insufficient protein digestion and inappropriate protein metabolism. Lack 
of undigested cereal grains indicates proper digestion.

### BIOCHEMICAL EXAMINATION

#### What does it mean when the test is positive?
- Blood in feces is an alarming symptom, most often its presence may indicate serious gastrointestinal 
problems. Among causes giving positive result, injuries along the entire digestive tract should be 
mentioned, including pharmacological injuries.

- Deviation from pH norm in feces, presence of reducing substances, and occult blood may indicate 
improper feed processing in the digestive tract. Metabolic disorders or inflammatory processes in the 
gut. Monitoring these parameters allows for early detection of irregularities and implementation of 
appropriate therapy.

**Results:**
- **Fecal consistency:** Soft, well-formed, 8.0
- **Occult blood:** Not observed
- **Occult blood (human):** Present, significantly increased ↑
- **Reducing substances:** Not observed

### DESCRIPTION:
In the biochemical examination of fecal pH, result 8.0, which is slightly alkaline. This result is 
higher than suggested reference values. Excess alkaline pH may be due to diet low in fiber, which 
produces fermentation products, and other dietary problems or internal inflammatory conditions. Lack 
of reducing substances in feces indicates proper digestion and absorption of carbohydrates. Occult 
blood in feces using the human test may indicate false positive result due to dietary factors, 
which may result from ingestion of blood or heme compounds present in feed.

### Header Question:
**What is the purpose of genetic examination of gut microflora?**

Genetic examination of gut microflora is performed for comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora of 
the digestive tract, identification of dysbiosis disorders, and assessment of their impact on the 
animal's health. It allows for precise determination of system dysfunction, which may lead to 
problems with digestion, metabolism, and even behavioral problems. Additionally, it can help in 
early identification of potentially dangerous bacteria, as well as determine the overall microbial 
diversity, selecting appropriate therapy tailored to the animal's individual needs, and supporting 
veterinary doctors in making accurate treatment decisions and dietary prophylaxis.

### Two-Column Comparison:

#### Positive Gut Microbiome
Positive bacteria supporting digestion, producing substances nourishing intestinal epithelium and 
supporting proper metabolism growth and animal's overall condition between positive and pathogenic 
flora is maintained.

**Examples:**
- Faecalibacterium spp.
- Fusicatenifer spp.
- Bifidobacterium spp.
- Blautia spp.
- Ruminococcus hominins
- Subdoligranulum spp.
- Eubacterium spp.

#### Pathogenic Gut Microbiome
Excess of pathogenic microorganisms causes disorders of normal intestinal function in the body, 
inflammatory conditions and disrupts nutrient absorption, leading to worsening of the animal's 
condition.

**Examples:**
- Clostridium perfringens
- Escherichia coli
- Campylobacter spp.
- Salmonella spp.
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Listeria monocytogenes
- Staphylococcus pseudintermedius
- Campylobacter spp.

### Bottom Section:

#### Positive method for sequencing allows identification of:
Species composition of bacteria, Phytopathogenic genomes (viruses, parasites, bacteria), Percentage 
proportions of species, such as Plasmodium spp. (eimeria), Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis), 
Cryptosporidium spp. (cryptosporidiosis), Giardia spp. (giardiasis), and Leishmania spp., 
Trypanosoma spp., responsible for leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis. The test covers 
detection of bacteria from the Rickettsia genus, as well as pathogenic viruses in this group 
(rotaviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses). In the future, it can also detect microorganisms such 
as Encephalitozoon spp. (encephalitozoonosis), yeasts, such as Entamoeba histolytica 
(intestinal amebiasis), and fungi, in this Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis) and 
Tritrichomonas foetus, the causative agent of cat trichomoniasis.

In addition to parasites, we can also detect genomes of viruses that may be significant in 
veterinary diagnostics and treatment. Bacteria (and other microorganisms), such as Bartonella spp., 
have been noted and coronavirus, and others causing diarrhea in animals, and Parvovirus (Canine 
parvovirus, Feline panleukopenia virus), protozoa that cause bloody diarrhea among young animals, 
and Astrovirus, and Enterovirus, associated with gastrointestinal infections in various animals. 
Analysis of unicellular parasite genome also identifies viruses of emerging diseases, such as 
Hepatitis E in pigs, horses, and dogs. Feline Virus (Canine adenovirus), Norovirus, and other 
enteric viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Additionally, new types of Adenovirus 
(Canine adenovirus), Norovirus, and other viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route, 
new genera of bacteria are added to the sequencing databases, and analysis of emerging diagnostics 
and analysis of microflora.

### What is Gut Dysbiosis?

Gut microbiome imbalance among positive and pathogenic microorganisms. It is a condition where 
pathogenic bacteria multiply excessively, and their pathogenic products change microbiome 
composition, gut microbiome condition is disturbed. Gut microbiome imbalance is a basic cause 
of many inflammatory conditions - including inflammatory bowel diseases, diarrhea, and colic. 
Prolonged dysbiosis may lead to metabolic disorders, autoimmune conditions, allergies, or even 
Head Shaking Syndrome.
